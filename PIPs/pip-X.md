Suggested Template for new PIPs.   
Raised PIPs should not affect the current version of protocol.  

### Guidelines
At time of submiting your PIPs please use an abbreviated filename pip-draft_title_abbrev.md.  
PIP number is provided by the editor.  
Title should less than X words.

## Synopsis
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the PIP.

## Abstract
Please provide a short (~xx word) description to addresses the technical issue.

## Motivation
Which motivation factor of yours leads to raise the PIP. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PIP solves. PIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current polymath platforms (polymath.js ...).

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for PIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other PIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
