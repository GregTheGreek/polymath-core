# Security Token Protocol

This document describes the protocol for Polymath security tokens.
Security Tokens use Polymath compliance templates to ensure regulatory compliance
in the jurisdictions they are being offered in. The security token protocol is used
to ensure security tokens remain interoperable and fully open source so anyone can
build on top of the Polymath platform.
